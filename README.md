## complementary split ring resonator
* This sensor was simulated using CST Microwave Studio
* Design - for material characterization at permittivity and permeability sensing area
* suggestion material under test(MUT) for sensing area : Teflon, FR4, magnetic material

* This is an example of how to design the sensor using CST Microwave Studio
